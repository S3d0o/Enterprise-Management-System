# Enterprise Management System (EMS)

A **full-stack ASP.NET Core MVC application** built using **Clean Architecture**, **SOLID principles**, and **enterprise-grade design patterns**.  
This project demonstrates how to design, build, and scale a modular system for managing employees, departments, users, and roles in a professional .NET environment.

---

## Overview

The **Enterprise Management System (EMS)** is developed to showcase clean, maintainable software design that mirrors real-world enterprise projects.  
It combines front-end interactivity with a robust back-end and emphasizes code organization, scalability, and security.

The project implements a **multi-layered architecture** to ensure separation of concerns, testability, and easy extensibility.

## Project Architecture
```bash
EnterpriseManagementSystem
│
├── EMS.Presentation        # MVC Layer (Controllers, Views, ViewModels)
├── EMS.BusinessLogic       # Business Layer (Services, DTOs, Interfaces)
└── EMS.DataAccess          # Data Layer (EF Core, Repositories, Context, Migrations)
```
This 3-layer architecture follows a clean separation of concerns and implements a fully modular design pattern.
Each layer communicates via abstractions, ensuring **flexibility** and **loose coupling**.

## Key Features

### Employee & Department Management
- Full CRUD operations for Employees and Departments  
- Department–Employee relationships  
- AJAX-powered search and live filtering  
- File and image uploads via Attachment Service  

### Authentication & Authorization
- Integrated **ASP.NET Identity** with custom `ApplicationUser` and `ApplicationRole`  
- Secure registration and login  
- Role-based access control (Admin / User)  
- Email confirmation and password reset via SMTP  

### User Interface & Experience
- **Bootstrap 5** + **jQuery** for responsive, modern UI  
- Dynamic AJAX operations for seamless interactivity  
- Modals and Toast notifications for user feedback  
- Validation using Data Annotations and client-side checks  

### Email System
- SMTP-based email confirmation and notifications  
- Reusable, template-driven email service  

## Core Infrastructure
- Repository & Unit of Work patterns for clean data access  
- AutoMapper for mapping between Entities, DTOs, and ViewModels  
- Dependency Injection for modular service management  
- Configurable settings through `appsettings.json`
