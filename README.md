# Enterprise Management System (EMS)

A **full-stack ASP.NET Core MVC application** built using **Clean Architecture**, **SOLID principles**, and **enterprise-grade design patterns**.  
This project demonstrates how to design, build, and scale a modular system for managing employees, departments, users, and roles in a professional .NET environment.

---

## Overview

The **Enterprise Management System (EMS)** is developed to showcase clean, maintainable software design that mirrors real-world enterprise projects.  
It combines front-end interactivity with a robust back-end and emphasizes code organization, scalability, and security.

The project implements a **multi-layered architecture** to ensure separation of concerns, testability, and easy extensibility.

## Project Architecture
```bash
EnterpriseManagementSystem
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EMS.Presentation        # MVC Layer (Controllers, Views, ViewModels)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EMS.BusinessLogic       # Business Layer (Services, DTOs, Interfaces)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EMS.DataAccess          # Data Layer (EF Core, Repositories, Context, Migrations)
```
This 3-layer architecture follows a clean separation of concerns and implements a fully modular design pattern.
Each layer communicates via abstractions, ensuring **flexibility** and **loose coupling**.
